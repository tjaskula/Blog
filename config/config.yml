    F# and functional programming is the topic I'm interested in and passionate about at the moment.
    However, software architecture, software craftsmanship, Domain Driven Design
    are also topics dear to my heart. I don't restrict myself to talk only about these
    but will pick up topics that are of interest to me :)
