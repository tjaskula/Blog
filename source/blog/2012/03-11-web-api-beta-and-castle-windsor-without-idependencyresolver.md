I've been reading through several blog post about how people configure DI support in the new [ASP.NET Web Api](http://www.asp.net/web-api). For example you can read about it here :

What stands out is that every implementation relays on `System.Web.Http.Services.IDependencyResolver` interface which is similar to the one introduced in the ASP.NET MVC 3 and which lives in the `System.Web.Mvc` namespace to avoid confusion. Let's look at its implementation details :

	[lang=csharp]
	public interface IDependencyResolver
    {
    	object GetService(System.Type serviceType);
        IEnumerable<object> GetServices(System.Type serviceType);
    }
