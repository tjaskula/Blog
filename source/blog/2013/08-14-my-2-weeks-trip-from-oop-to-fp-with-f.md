I have been programming using an OOP language since a long, long time. Really? Since the very first betas of .NET Framework I've been always using C# to accomplish almost every programming task. Working for companies that mainly used .NET platform and C# didn't help me to push me in another direction... It's not that I was not interested in other languages...it's that I was afraid that the learning curve will be so high and that I will never have enough time to learn everything to know in order to be efficient and to write a code that follows the best practices for a given language.
