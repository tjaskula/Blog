# Machine Learning

## Use cases

Spam filtering, priority filtering, smart tagging, product recommendations

## General information

There are three main types of machine learning:

* classification: multiple choice answers, each corresponding to a class like email's "spam vs. ham,"" it uses predictive analysis to answer the question: "What type of email is this?""
* regression: numerical answers, like the value of a house assessed by a real estate agent. Take characteristics of houses on the market like number of bedrooms and bathrooms, overall size, and year built along with their pricing information. With machine learning, we are trying to fill in the missing values of new houses to market, based on the input you can give. The ML should give the pricing output.
* recommendation: Simply, given this user, what are the top five products to show him?
