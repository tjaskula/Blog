    Description = "Machine learning is a subfield of computer science[1] that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. " +
    			  "Machine learning explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. " +
    			  "Such algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs in order to make data-driven predictions or decisions, rather than following strictly static program instructions.";
